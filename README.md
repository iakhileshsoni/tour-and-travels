# tour-and-travels

This is my another project in Python/Django. 

I have used technologies like -  HTML5, CSS3, Bootsrtap, JavaScript, Pillow library of Python for working with images.

In this project basically I have covered all the useful features using the MVT structure that Django follows.

I have created form for registration, login, logout, show_records from the database(MySQL).

At the end I have done some validation stuff but still few functionalities need to be added that I am working on in development mode.
